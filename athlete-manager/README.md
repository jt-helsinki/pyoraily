# Federated Module Placeholder

- The intention of this sub-project is to provide a sample application which can be used as a federated module by the "shell" sub-project.
- It can be used to spike new features but only minimal changes should be checked into the main branch in source control.
- This projecte must not be deployed into production.
- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running the app

To start this sub-project as a standalone application simply run:

`npm start`

Alternatively, if you are running the Shell, User Management MS and this application together, from the root of this entire Auroral project
run:

`npm start`
